<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> two extremely rare tracts here given have been reprinted by Prof.
Arber in his &#8220;English Garner,&#8221; if we can call <i>reprinting</i> the issuing of
a pamphlet not only with the spelling entirely modernised, but also with
words and phrases inserted or inverted to suit the Editor&#8217;s taste. In the
&#8220;<i>Tryumphe at Caleys</i>&#8221; Mr Arber has issued the Second Edition, giving us
no particulars whatever as to the First. In the list of the noblemen of
France, Mr Arber modernises the names and yet gives us a Cardinal
<i>Gramond</i>, being evidently unaware of the existence of the noble family of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>de Grammont, and he equally fails to recognise in the Comte de Tonnore,
the celebrated Armand, Comte de Tonnerre. Anne de Montmerancy remains for
him an unknown actor on the brilliant stage, and yet, surely, the name of
the Montmorency must have reached his ears.</p>

<p>I have here given an absolute reprint of the first edition and have noted
at the foot of each page any variations in the readings which occur in the
second. Both Editions were printed by Wynkyn de Worde, probably about
November, 1532. The collation according to the copies in the British
Museum (c. 21, b. 20) is as follows. It is a black letter, unpaged tract
of four leaves. Page 1 contains the title, with a woodcut of Henry VIII.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>on horseback, with two attendants.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> Page 2 is blank in the First
Edition but contains a list of the noblemen of France in the second. Then
come five pages of text in the First Edition, followed by page 8 blank,
whilst the Second Edition has six pages of text. The second tract, &#8220;The
Cornacyon of Quene Anne,&#8221; was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1533. I trust
the few notes I have added, either for the purpose of explaining obsolete
words or to give a slight clue to the identity of the more important
persons mentioned, may prove of use to the student.</p>
